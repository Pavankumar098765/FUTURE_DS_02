Social Media Campaign Performance Dashboard – Project Description  This project focuses on building an interactive Social Media Campaign Performance Dashboard that helps a marketing team understand how their ads and posts are performing across different platforms (like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.).
The main goal is to bring all campaign data into one place and turn raw numbers (impressions, clicks, spends) into simple, visual insights that can support better decisions.

Objective

To track and compare the performance of different social media campaigns in one dashboard.

To identify which campaigns, platforms, and creatives are performing best.

To help the team optimize budget, improve engagement, and increase conversions.

Data & Metrics

The dashboard is built using a social media ads dataset (similar to Facebook/Instagram/Google Ads exports) containing information about:

Campaign name / ad set / ad name

Platform or channel

Date / time period

Impressions, reach, clicks

Spend / cost

Conversions / leads / purchases

Revenue (if available)

From this data, the dashboard calculates and visualizes important marketing KPIs, such as:

Impressions & Reach – how many people saw the ads

Clicks & Click-Through Rate (CTR) – how many people clicked and how effective the creatives are

Cost Per Click (CPC) – how much it costs to get one click

Conversions & Conversion Rate – how many people completed the desired action (form fill, sign-up, purchase)

Cost Per Conversion (CPA) – cost to get one lead or customer

Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) – revenue generated for every ₹1 spent (if revenue is present)

Engagement Rate – likes, shares, comments vs total reach (if engagement columns exist)

Dashboard Sections / Views

The dashboard is designed to be interactive and visual, usually including:
